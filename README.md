ive decided to release my collection of lecture minutes in the hopes that it aids you in your study like it has for me(dont mind grammmer pls)<br/>
<br/>
THERE ARE TYPOS, so if "cntrl-f" doesnt catch it with proper spelling check with borken speling (for example, tristate vs tri state,, flip flop vs ff vs flipflop,, karno vs karnough vs kmap)<br/>
<br/>
im also not the most thorough, so there are topics that can be missed<br/>
<br/>
the minute associated with a topic is not dead accurate(except like 1 or 2 times). the topic covered is usually 1 or so minute before it's actually brought up in lecture<br/>
if its not 2 minutes before its 2 minutes after. if its neither of those, good luck ig<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i plan on updating this github page as time goes on<br/>
