ive decided to release my collection of lecture minutes in the hopes that it aids you in your study like it has for me(dont mind grammmer pls)

THERE ARE TYPOS, so if "cntrl-f" doesnt catch it with proper spelling then check with borken speling (for example, tristate vs tri state,, flip flop vs ff vs flipflop,, karno vs karnough vs kmap)

im also not the most thorough, so there are topics that can be missed

the minute associated with a topic is not dead accurate. the topic covered is usually 1 or so minute before it's actually brought up in lecture


i plan on updating this github page as time goes on


the usual organization form:


+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+= month - date day lecture/discussion +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
topic - minute (usually +-1,2 minutes of topic actually being brought up)
  subtopic - minute
+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+= month - date day lecture/discussion +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

================================================================================================================================    <<<---- day seperator (friday discussion & lecture are same day)
================================================================================================================================

+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+= month - date day lecture/discussion +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
topic - minute 
  subtopic - minute
+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+= month - date day lecture/discussion +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
